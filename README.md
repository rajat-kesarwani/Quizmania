# Quizmania
Created a web service with Spring Boot by which users can give quizzes in a real-time environment and can see the result after submitting the quiz in the given time span. Apart from the user side admin can also allow storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting the quizzes with the help of Angular UI and MySQL database.
